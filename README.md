# Muninn

Muninn is a clone of [Huginn](https://github.com/huginn/huginn) written in Swift. Having used Huginn for a little while I wanted to put my own spin on it, that's why this exists. Huginn is far more powerful and supported, so please use that instead. This will likely stay a playground for myself for quite some time.

**What does it do?**

Muninn aims to empower you to run *agents* gathering data and generating *events* on your behalf, for a multitude of purposes. You create workflows by combining several agents and let muninn handle running them. Several agents are included and it should be trivial to write your own for whatever exotic purposes you might need.

**What's up with the name?**

Huginn and Muninn are the ravens that keep Odin informed about events going on in the world.
